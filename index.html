About
I was born and raised on O'ahu, Hawaii. 
I have a BA in Creative Media and have experience in the Adobe Creative Cloud System (Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign). 
In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, watching shows, and listening to music. 
I'm learning to code for fun to create cool things!
